= Introduction to Hibernate Reactive

:example: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-reactive/tree/main/examples/session-example

Creating a new project with Hibernate Reactive isn't hard at all. In
this short guide, we'll cover all the basic work involved in:

- setting up and configuring a project, and then
- writing Java code to define a data model and access the database.

Last, we'll discuss some topics related to performance that you'll need
to understand when you develop any large-scale project using Hibernate.

But, before you start, we recommend taking a quick look at the very
simplistic example program in the {example}[`session-example`] directory,
which shows off all the "bits" you'll need to get your own program up and
running.

== Information about Hibernate ORM

This document assumes some passing familiarity with Hibernate ORM or another
implementation of JPA. If you've never used JPA before, that's OK, but you
might need to refer to the following sources of information at some points
in this text:

- the http://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/5.6/[documentation for Hibernate ORM],
- the https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/mrel/jsr338/index.html[JPA 2.2 specification], or
- https://www.manning.com/books/java-persistence-with-hibernate-second-edition[Java Persistence with Hibernate],
  the latest edition of the book originally titled _Hibernate in Action_.

== Setting up a reactive Hibernate project

:skeleton: https://code.quarkus.io/?g=org.acme&a=code-with-quarkus&v=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT&b=MAVEN&c=org.acme.ExampleResource&s=r1s.8XW.fmW.ih0&cn=code.quarkus.io

If you're using Hibernate Reactive outside of the Quarkus environment,
you'll need to:

- include Hibernate Reactive itself, along with the appropriate Vert.x
  reactive database client, as dependencies of your project, and
- configure Hibernate Reactive with information about your database,
  using Hibernate configuration properties.

Or, if you want to use Hibernate Reactive in Quarkus, you can generate
a preconfigured skeleton project {skeleton}[right here].

=== Including Hibernate Reactive in your project build

:build: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-reactive/blob/main/examples/session-example/build.gradle

Add the following dependency to your project:

----
org.hibernate.reactive:hibernate-reactive-core:{version}
----

Where `{version}` is the version of Hibernate Reactive you're using.

You'll also need to add a dependency for the Vert.x reactive database
driver for your database, one of the following options:

|===
| Database                  | Driver dependency

| PostgreSQL or CockroachDB | `io.vertx:vertx-pg-client:{vertxVersion}`
| MySQL or MariaDB          | `io.vertx:vertx-mysql-client:{vertxVersion}`
| DB2                       | `io.vertx:vertx-db2-client:{vertxVersion}`
| SQL Server                | `io.vertx:vertx-mssql-client:${vertxVersion}`
| Oracle                    | `io.vertx:vertx-oracle-client:${vertxVersion}`
|===

Where `{vertxVersion}` is the version of Vert.x compatible with the
version of Hibernate Reactive you're using.

You don't need to depend on the JDBC driver for your database.

=== Optional dependencies

:slf4j: http://www.slf4j.org/
:enhancer: https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/topical/html_single/bytecode/BytecodeEnhancement.html

Optionally, you might also add any of the following additional features:

|===
| Optional feature | Dependencies

| An {slf4j}[SLF4J] logging implementation | `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` or `org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14`
| The Hibernate metamodel generator, if you're using the JPA criteria query API | `org.hibernate:hibernate-jpamodelgen`
| Hibernate Validator | `org.hibernate.validator:hibernate-validator` and `org.glassfish:jakarta.el`
| Compile-time checking for your HQL queries | `org.hibernate:query-validator`
| Second-level cache support via JCache and EHCache | `org.hibernate:hibernate-jcache` along with `org.ehcache:ehcache`
| SCRAM authentication support for PostgreSQL | `com.ongres.scram:client:2.1`
|===

You might also add the Hibernate {enhancer}[bytecode enhancer] to your
Gradle build if you want to use field-level  lazy fetching.

TIP: Field-level lazy fetching is an advanced feature that most programs
don't need. Stick to the basics for now.

There's an example {build}[Gradle build] included in the example program.

=== Basic configuration

:xml: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-reactive/blob/main/examples/session-example/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml
:configuration-properties: https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#configurations


Hibernate Reactive is configured via the standard JPA `persistence.xml`
document which must be placed, as usual, in the `/META-INF` directory.

An example {xml}[`persistence.xml`] file is included in the example
program.

The only required configuration that's really specific to Hibernate
Reactive is the persistence `<provider>` element, which must be explicit:

[source,xml]
----
<provider>org.hibernate.reactive.provider.ReactivePersistenceProvider</provider>
----

Otherwise, configuration is almost completely transparent&mdash;you can
configure Hibernate Reactive pretty much exactly as you would usually
configure Hibernate ORM core.

Just like in regular JPA, you should list your entity classes in `persistence.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<class>org.hibernate.reactive.example.session.Author</class>
<class>org.hibernate.reactive.example.session.Book</class>
----

A full list of configuration properties recognized by Hibernate may be
found in the {configuration-properties}[documentation for Hibernate ORM].
You'll never need to touch most of these. The properties you do need at
this stage are these three:

|===
| Configuration property name                                         | Purpose

| `javax.persistence.jdbc.url`                                        | JDBC URL of your database
| `javax.persistence.jdbc.user` and `javax.persistence.jdbc.password` | Your database credentials
|===

These configuration properties have `jdbc` in their names, but of course
there's no JDBC in Hibernate Reactive, and these are simply the legacy
property names defined by the JPA specification. In particular, Hibernate
Reactive itself parses and interprets the JDBC URL.

TIP: You don't need to specify `hibernate.dialect`. The correct Hibernate
`Dialect` will be determined for you by Hibernate Reactive.

The Vert.x database client has built-in connection pooling and prepared
statement caching. You might want to control the size of the connection
pool:

|===
| Configuration property name      | Purpose

| `hibernate.connection.pool_size` | The maximum size of the reactive connection pool
|===

We'll learn about more advanced connection pool tuning later, in
<<_tuning_the_vert_x_pool>>.

TIP: Hibernate has many configurable things, but many exist only to
maintain compatibility with legacy code, and most configuration properties
directly related to JDBC or JTA aren't relevant in the context of Hibernate
Reactive.

=== Automatic schema export

You can have Hibernate Reactive infer your database schema from the mapping
annotation you've specified in your Java code, and export the schema at
initialization time by specifying one or more of the following configuration
properties:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Configuration property name                                | Purpose

| `javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action` 
a| * If `create`, first drop the schema and then export tables, sequences, and constraints.
   * If `create-only`, export tables, sequences, and constraints.
   * If `create-drop`, drop the schema and recreate it on SessionFactory startup.
     Additionally, drop the schema on SessionFactory shutdown.
   * If `drop`, drop the schema on SessionFactory shutdown.
   * If `validate`, validate the database schema without changing it.
   * If `update`, only export what's missing in the schema.

| `javax.persistence.create-database-schemas`
| (Optional) If `true`, automatically create schemas and catalogs

| `javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-source`
| (Optional) If `metadata-then-script` or `script-then-metadata`, execute an additional SQL script when exported tables and sequences

| `javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source`
| (Optional) The name of the SQL script to be executed
|===

This feature is extremely useful for testing.

IMPORTANT: Hibernate Reactive doesn't support `validate` and `update` with Db2.

Schema export uses blocking operations so starting the factory might require special
handling when using it. Failing to do so will cause an exception:

[source,java]
----
io.vertx.core.VertxException: Thread blocked
----

You can solve this issue using `executeBlocking`:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = ...

Uni<Void> startHibernate = Uni.createFrom().deferred(() -> {
  emf = Persistence
    .createEntityManagerFactory("demo")
    .unwrap(Mutiny.SessionFactory.class);

  return Uni.createFrom().voidItem();
});

startHibernate = vertx.executeBlocking(startHibernate)
  .onItem().invoke(() -> logger.info("âœ… Hibernate Reactive is ready"));
----

=== Logging the generated SQL

:log4j: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-reactive/blob/main/examples/session-example/src/main/resources/log4j2.properties

To see the generated SQL as it's sent to the database, either:

- set the property `hibernate.show_sql` to `true`, or
- enable debug-level logging for the category `org.hibernate.SQL`
  using your preferred SLF4J logging implementation.

For example, if you're using Log4J 2 (as above in <<_optional_dependencies>>),
add these lines to your `log4j2.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
logger.hibernate.name = org.hibernate.SQL
logger.hibernate.level = debug
----

An example {log4j}[`log4j2.properties`] file is included in the example
program.

You can make the logged SQL more readable by enabling one or both of
the following settings:

|===
| Configuration property name | Purpose

| `hibernate.format_sql`      | If `true`, log SQL in a multiline, indented format
| `hibernate.highlight_sql`   | If `true`, log SQL with syntax highlighting via ANSI escape codes
|===

=== Minimizing repetitive mapping information

The following properties are very useful for minimizing the amount of
information you'll need to explicitly specify in `@Table` and `@Column`
annotations which we'll discuss below in <<_mapping_entity_classes>>:

|===
| Configuration property name           | Purpose

| `hibernate.default_schema`            | A default schema name for entities which do not explicitly declare one
| `hibernate.default_catalog`           | A default catalog name for entities which do not explicitly declare one
| `hibernate.physical_naming_strategy`  | A `PhysicalNamingStrategy` implementing your database naming standards
|===

TIP: Writing your own `PhysicalNamingStrategy` is an especially good
way to reduce the clutter of annotations on your entity classes, and
we think you should do it for any nontrivial data model.

=== Nationalized character data in SQL Server

_By default,_ SQL Server's `char` and `varchar` types don't accommodate
Unicode data. So, if you're working with SQL Server, you might need to
force Hibernate to use the `nchar` and `nvarchar` types.

|===
| Configuration property name                 | Purpose

| `hibernate.use_nationalized_character_data` | Use `nchar` and `nvarchar` instead of `char` and `varchar`
|===

TIP: Alternatively, you can configure SQL Server to use the UTF-8 enabled
collation `_UTF8`.

== Writing the Java code

With that out of the way, we're all set to write some Java code!

As is the case in any project that uses Hibernate, your
persistence-related code comes in two main pieces:

. a representation of your data model in Java, which takes the form
  of a set of annotated entity classes, and
. a larger number of functions which interact with Hibernate's APIs
  to perform the persistence operations associated with your various
  transactions.

The first part, the data or "domain" model, is usually easier to write,
but doing a great and very clean job of it will strongly affect your
success in the second part.

TIP: Take your time with this code, and try to produce a Java model
that's as close as reasonable to the relational data model. Avoid using
exotic or advanced mapping features when they're not really needed.
When in the slightest doubt, map a foreign key relationship using
`@ManyToOne` with `@OneToMany(mappedBy=...)` in preference to more
complicated association mappings.

The second part of the code is much trickier to get right. This code must:

- manage transactions and reactive sessions,
- construct reactive streams by chaining persistence operations invoked
  on the reactive session,
- fetch and prepare data needed by the UI, and
- handle failures.

TIP: Some responsibility for transaction and session management, and for
recovery from certain kinds of failure, can be best handled in some sort
of framework code.

=== Mapping entity classes

:mapping-annotations: https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#annotations
:bean-validation: https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#chapter-bean-constraints

We won't have much to say about the entity classes here, simply because
the principles behind mapping entity classes in Hibernate Reactive,
along with the actual mapping annotations you'll use, are all identical
to regular Hibernate ORM and other implementations of JPA.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="authors")
class Author {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Integer id;

    @NotNull @Size(max=100)
    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "author", cascade = PERSIST)
    private List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

    Author(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    Author() {}

    // getters and setters...
}
----

You're quite free to mix and match:

- the regular JPA mapping annotations defined in the package
  `javax.persistence` with
- the advanced mapping annotations in `org.hibernate.annotations`, and even
- annotations like `@NotNull` and `@Size` defined by Bean Validation.

A full list of object/relational mapping annotations may be found in the
{mapping-annotations}[documentation for Hibernate ORM]. Most mapping
annotations are already supported in Hibernate Reactive, though there are
still a handful of limitations at this time.

==== Common JPA annotations

The most common and useful mapping annotations include these standard JPA
annotations:

|===
| Annotation          | Purpose

| `@Entity`           | Declares an entity class (a class with its own
                        database table an persistent identity)
| `@MappedSuperclass` | A superclass that declares common persistent
                        fields of its `@Entity` subclasses
| `@Embeddable` or
  `@Embedded`         | Declare an embeddable class (a class without its
                        own persistent identity or database table)
| `@Inheritance`      | Defines how inheritance hierarchies should be
                        mapped to database tables
| `@Id`               | Specifies that a field of an entity holds the
                        persistent identity of the entity, and maps to
                        the primary key of its table
| `@IdClass`          | Specifies a class representing the composite
                        primary key of the entity (for entities with
                        multiple `@Id` fields)
| `@EmbeddedId`       | Specifies that a field of an entity holds its
                        composite primary key represented as an
                        `@Embeddable` class
| `@GeneratedValue`   | Specifies that an identifier is a system-generated
                        surrogate key
| `@Version`          | Specifies that a field of an entity holds a version
                        number used for optimistic locking
| `@Enumerated`       | Maps a field holding an `enum`
| `@ManyToOne`        | Declares a many-to-one association to a second
                        entity
| `@OneToOne`         | Declares a one-to-one association to a second
                        entity
| `@OneToMany`        | Declares a one-to-many association to a second
                        entity
| `@Table`            | Specifies a mapping to a database table
| `@SecondaryTable`   | Specifies a mapping to a second database table
| `@Column`           | Specifies a mapping to a database column
| `@JoinColumn`       | Specifies a mapping to a database foreign key
|===

==== Useful Hibernate annotations

These Hibernate annotations are also quite useful to know about:

|===
| Annotation                               | Purpose

| `@Cache`                                 | Enables second-level caching for an entity
| `@Formula`                               | Maps field to SQL expression instead of a column
| `@CreationTimestamp`, `@UpdateTimestamp` | Automatically assign a timestamp to a field
| `@OptimisticLocking`                     | Enables optimistic locking for entities with no
                                             `@Version` field
| `@FilterDef` and `@Filter`               | Define a Hibernate filter
| `@FetchProfile`                          | Defines a Hibernate fetch profile
| `@Generated`                             | Defines a property generated by the database
| `@ColumnDefault`                         | Specifies a SQL expression used to assign a
                                             default value to a column
                                             (use in combination with `@Generated(INSERT)`)
| `@GenericGenerator`                      | Selects a custom id generator
| `@DynamicInsert` and `@DynamicUpdate`    | Generate SQL dynamically with only needed columns
                                             (instead of using static SQL generated at startup)
| `@Fetch`                                 | Specifies the fetching mode for an association
| `@BatchSize`                             | Specifies the batch size for batch fetching an
                                             association
| `@Loader`                                | Specifies a named query used to fetch an entity by
                                             id (for example, when `find(type, id)` is called)
                                             in place of the default SQL generated by Hibernate
| `@SqlInsert`, `@SqlUpdate`, `@SqlDelete` | Specify custom DML for entity operations
| `@NaturalId`                             | Marks a field or fields as an alternative "natural"
                                             identifier (unique key) of the entity
| `@Nationalized`                          | Use `nchar`, `nvarchar`, or `nclob` selectively
                                             for one particular column.
| `@Immutable`                             | Specifies that an entity or collection is immutable
| `@SortNatural` or `@SortComparator`     | Maps a `SortedSet` or `SortedMap`
| `@Check`                                 | Declares a SQL `check` constraint to be added to DDL
|===

==== Bean Validation annotations

Information about Bean Validation annotations may be found in the
{bean-validation}[documentation for Hibernate Validator].

TIP: for defining a required field, we prefer to use the `@NotNull`
annotation from Bean Validation instead of JPA's more verbose
`@Basic(optional=false)`. Similarly, we prefer to define the length of a
text field using `@Size(100)` rather than `@Column(length=100)`.

=== Getters and setters

When using Hibernate Reactive _outside_ the Quarkus environment, you'll
need to write your entity classes according to the usual JPA conventions,
which require:

- private fields for persistent attributes, and
- a nullary constructor.

It's illegal to access persistent fields from outside the entity class.
Therefore, external access to persistent fields must be intermediated via
getter and setter methods defined by the entity class.

IMPORTANT: If you access fields of an unfetched entity instance from code
outside the entity class, you'll obtain bogus `null` or default (zero)
values!

When you use Hibernate Reactive in Quarkus, these requirements are relaxed,
and you can use public fields instead of getters and setters if you prefer.

=== `equals()` and `hashCode()`

Entity classes should override `equals()` and `hashCode()`. People new to
Hibernate or JPA are often confused by exactly which fields should be
included in the `hashCode()`, so please keep the following principles in
mind:

- You should not include mutable fields in the hashcode, since that would
  require rehashing any collection containing the entity whenever the field
  is mutated.
- It's not completely wrong to include a generated identifier (surrogate
  key) in the hashcode, but since the identifier is not generated until
  the entity instance is made persistent, you must take great care to not
  add it to any hashed collection before the identifier is generated. We
  therefore advise against including any database-generated field in the
  hashcode.

It's OK to include any immutable, non-generated field in the hashcode.

TIP: We therefore recommend identifying a _natural key_ for each entity,
that is, a combination of fields that uniquely identifies an instance of
the entity, from the perspective of the data model of the program. The
business key should correspond to a unique constraint on the database,
and to the fields which are included in `equals()` and `hashCode()`.

That said, an implementation of `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on the
generated identifier of the entity can work _if you're careful_.

IMPORTANT: If you can't identify a natural key, it might be a sign that
you need to think more carefully about some aspect of your data model.
If an entity doesn't have a meaningful unique key, then it's impossible
to say what event or object it represents in the "real world" outside
your program.

Note that even when you've identified a natural key, we still recommend
the use of a generated surrogate key in foreign keys, since this makes
your data model _much_ easier to change.

=== Identifier generation

One area where the functionality of Hibernate Reactive diverges from plain
Hibernate is in the area of id generation. Custom identifier generators
written to work with Hibernate ORM and JDBC will _not_ work in the reactive
environment.

- Sequence, table, and `UUID` id generation is built in, and these id
  generation strategies may be selected using the usual JPA mapping
  annotations: `@GeneratedValue`, `@TableGenerator`, `@SequenceGenerator`.
- On MySQL, an autoincrement column may be used by specifying
  `@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)`
- Custom id generators may be defined by implementing `ReactiveIdentifierGenerator`
  and declaring the custom implementation using `@GenericGenerator`.
- Natural ids&mdash;including composite ids&mdash;may be assigned by the
  program in the usual way.

The standard id generation strategies defined by the JPA specification may
be customized using the following annotations:

|===
| Annotation           | Purpose

| `@SequenceGenerator` | Configure a generator based on a database sequence
| `@TableGenerator`    | Configure a generator based on a row of a database table
|===

For example, sequence id generation may be specified like this:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="authors")
class Author {
    @Id @GeneratedValue(generator = "authorIds")
    @SequenceGenerator(name = "authorIds",
               sequenceName = "author_ids",
             allocationSize = 20)
    Integer id;
    ...
}
----

You can find more information in the JPA specification.

If you have very particular requirements, you can check out the Javadoc of
`ReactiveIdentifierGenerator` for information on how to implement your own
custom reactive identifier generator.

=== Custom types

Hibernate custom types based on the `UserType` interface are targeted toward
use with JDBC, and depend on interfaces defined by JDBC. So Hibernate Reactive
features an adaptor that exposes a partial implementation of JDBC to the
`UserType` implementation.

Therefore, _some_ existing `UserType` implementations will work in Hibernate
Reactive, depending upon precisely which features of JDBC they depend on.

TIP: Where possible, use a JPA attribute converter instead of a custom type,
since attribute converters are not in any way tied to JDBC.

You may specify a custom type by annotating a field of an entity class with
the Hibernate `@Type` annotation.

=== Attribute converters

Any JPA `AttributeConverter` works in Hibernate Reactive. For example:

[source,java]
----
@Converter
public class BigIntegerAsString implements AttributeConverter<BigInteger, String> {
    @Override
    public String convertToDatabaseColumn(BigInteger attribute) {
        return attribute == null ? null : attribute.toString(2);
    }

    @Override
    public BigInteger convertToEntityAttribute(String string) {
        return string == null ? null : new BigInteger(string, 2);
    }
}
----

You'll need to use one or both of these annotations:

|===
| Annotation        | Purpose

| `@Converter`      | Declares a class implementing `AttributeConverter`
| `@Convert`        | Specifies an `AttributeConverter` converter to use
                      for a field of an entity class
|===

You'll find more information in the Javadoc for these annotations and in the
JPA specification.

=== APIs for chaining reactive operations

:Mutiny: https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/

When you write persistence logic using Hibernate Reactive, you'll be working
with a reactive `Session` most of the time. Just to make things a little more
confusing for new users, the reactive `Session` and its related interfaces all
come in two flavors:

- `Stage.Session` and friends provide a reactive API based around Java's
  `CompletionStage`, and
- `Mutiny.Session` and friends provide an API based on {Mutiny}[Mutiny].

You'll need to decide which API you want to use!

TIP: If you take the time to look over the types `Stage.Session` and
`Mutiny.Session`, you'll notice they're almost identical. Choosing between
them is a matter of deciding which reactive API you want to use for working
with reactive streams. Your decision won't affect what you can do with
Hibernate Reactive. On the other hand, we've sent a lot of feedback and
requests for improvement to the Mutiny team, and we think it's now the case
that Hibernate Reactive code is simpler and cleaner with Mutiny.

These are the most important operations on reactive streams that you'll need
all the time when working with Hibernate Reactive:

|===
| Purpose                                  | Java `CompletionStage` | Mutiny `Uni`

| Chain non-blocking operations            | `thenCompose()`        | `chain()`
| Transform streamed items                 | `thenApply()`          | `map()` and `replaceWith()`
| Perform an action using streamed items   | `thenAccept()`         | `invoke()` and `call()`
| Perform cleanup (similar to `finally`)   | `whenComplete()`       | `eventually()`
|===

In this introduction, our code examples usually use Mutiny. If you're more
familiar with `CompletionStage`, you can refer to the above table to help
you understand the code.

When we use the term _reactive stream_ in this document, we mean:

- a chain of ``CompletionStage``s, or
- a chain of Mutiny ``Uni``s and ``Multi``s

that is built by the program in order to service a particular request,
transaction, or unit of work.

=== Obtaining a reactive session factory

Whatever you decide, the first step to getting a reactive session is to obtain
a JPA `EntityManagerFactory` just as you usually would in plain ol' regular JPA,
for example, by calling:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("example");
----

Now, `unwrap()` the reactive `SessionFactory`. If you want to use
``CompletionStage``s for chaining reactive operations, ask for a
`Stage.SessionFactory`:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
Stage.SessionFactory sessionFactory = emf.unwrap(Stage.SessionFactory.class);
----

Or, if you prefer to use the Mutiny-based API, `unwrap()` the type
`Mutiny.SessionFactory`:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
Mutiny.SessionFactory sessionFactory = emf.unwrap(Mutiny.SessionFactory.class);
----

Reactive sessions may be obtained from the resulting reactive `SessionFactory`.

TIP: It's also possible to construct a reactive `SessionFactory` via programmatic
configuration based on Hibernate's `ServiceRegistry` architecture, by using a
`ReactiveServiceRegistryBuilder`. But that's outside the scope of this document.

=== Obtaining a reactive session

Persistence operations are exposed via a reactive `Session` object. It's very
important to understand that most operations of this interface are non-blocking,
and execution of SQL against the database is never performed synchronously.
Persistence operations that belong to a single unit of work must be chained by
composition within a single reactive stream.

Also remember that a Hibernate session is a lightweight object that should be
created, used, and then discarded within a single logical unit of work.

IMPORTANT: That is to say, you _should_ reuse the same session across multiple
persistence operations within a single reactive stream representing a certain
transaction or unit of work, but _don't_ share a session between different
concurrent reactive streams!

To obtain a reactive `Session` from the `SessionFactory`, use `withSession()`:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
sessionFactory.withSession(
        session -> session.find(Book.class, id)
                .invoke(
                    book -> ... //do something with the book
                )
);
----

The resulting `Session` object is automatically associated with the current
reactive stream, and so nested calls to `withSession()` in a given stream
automatically obtain the same shared session.

Alternatively, you may use `openSession()`, but you must remember to `close()`
the session when you're done.
And you must take great care to only access each session from within exactly
one Vert.x context. (See <<_sessions_and_vert_x_contexts>> more on this).

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
Uni<Session> sessionUni = sessionFactory.openSession();
sessionUni.chain(
        session -> session.find(Book.class, id)
                .invoke(
		    book -> ... //do something with the book
                )
                .eventually(session::close)
);
----

=== Using the reactive session

The `Session` interface has methods with the same names as methods of the JPA
`EntityManager`. You might already be familiar with the following session
operations defined by JPA:

|===
| Method name and parameters | Effect

| `find(Class,Object)` | Obtain a persistent object given its type and its id
                         (primary key)
| `persist(Object)`    | Make a transient object persistent and schedule a SQL
                         `insert` statement for later execution
| `remove(Object)`     | Make a persistent object transient and schedule a SQL
                         `delete` statement for later execution
| `merge(Object)`      | Copy the state of a given detached object to a
                         corresponding managed persistent instance and return
                         the persistent object
| `refresh(Object)`    | Refresh the persistent state of an object using a new
                         SQL `select` to retrieve the current state from the
                         database
| `lock(Object)`       | Obtain a pessimistic lock on a persistent object
| `flush()`            | Detect changes made to persistent objects association
                         with the session and synchronize the database state
                         with the state of the session by executing SQL `insert`,
                         `update`, and `delete` statements
| `detach(Object)`     | Disassociate a persistent object from a session without
                         affecting the database
| `getReference(Class,id)` or
  `getReference(Object)` | Obtain a reference to a persistent object without
                           actually loading its state from the database
|===

If you're not familiar with these operations, don't despair! Their semantics
are defined in the JPA specification, and in the API documentation, and are
explained in innumerable articles and blog posts. But if you already have some
experience with Hibernate or JPA, you're right at home!

IMPORTANT: Just like in Hibernate ORM, the session is considered to be unusable
after any of its methods throws an exception. If you receive an exception from
Hibernate Reactive, you should immediately close and discard the current session.

Now, _here's where Hibernate Reactive is different:_ in the reactive API, each
of these methods returns its result in a non-blocking fashion via a Java
`CompletionStage` (or Mutiny `Uni`). For example:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
session.find(Book.class, book.id)
       .invoke( book -> System.out.println(book.title + " is a great book!") )
----

On the other hand, methods with no meaningful return value just return
`CompletionStage<Void>` (or `Uni<Void>`).

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
session.find(Book.class, id)
       .call( book -> session.remove(book) )
       .call( () -> session.flush() )
----

TIP: The session will be flushed automatically at the end of a unit of work
if&mdash;and _only_ if&mdash;you use a transaction, as described below in
<<_transactions>>. If you don't use a transaction, and forget to flush the
session explicitly, your persistence operations might never be sent to the
database!

An _extremely_ common mistake when using reactive streams is to forget to
chain the return value of a "void-like" method. For example, in the following
code, the `flush()` operation is never executed, because `invoke()` doesn't
chain its return value to the tip of the stream.

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
session.find(Book.class, id)
       .call( book -> session.remove(book) )
       .invoke( () -> session.flush() )   //OOPS, WRONG!!
----

So remember:

- You must use `thenCompose()`, not `thenAccept()`, when calling "void-like"
  methods that return `CompletionStage`.
- In Mutiny, you must use `call()`, not `invoke()`, when calling "void-like"
  methods that return `Uni`.

The same problem occurs in the following code, but this time it's `remove()`
that never gets called:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
session.find(Book.class, id)
       .call( book -> {
           session.remove(book);   //OOPS, WRONG!!
           return session.flush();
       } )
----

If you already have some experience with reactive programming, there's nothing
new to learn here. But if you _are_ new to reactive programming, just be aware
that you're going to make this mistake, in some form, _at least_ once!

=== Queries

Naturally, the `Session` interface is a factory for `Query` instances which
allow you to set query parameters and execute queries and DML statements:

|===
| Method name           | Effect

| `createQuery()`       | Obtain a `Query` for executing a query or DML
                          statement written in HQL or JPQL
| `createNativeQuery()` | Obtain a `Query` for executing a query or DML
                          statement written in the native SQL dialect of
                          your database
| `createNamedQuery()`  | Obtain a `Query` for executing a named HQL or SQL
                          query defined by a `@NamedQuery` annotation
|===

That `createQuery()` method produces a reactive `Query`, allowing HQL / JPQL
queries to be executed asynchronously, always returning their results via a
`CompletionStage` (or `Uni`):

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
session.createQuery("select title from Book order by title desc")
       .getResultList()
       .invoke( list -> list.forEach(System.out::println) )
----

The `Query` interface defines the following important operations:

|===
| Method name         | Effect

| `setParameter()`    | Set an argument of a query parameter
| `setMaxResults()`   | Limit the number of results returned by the query
| `setFirstResult()`  | Specify a certain number of initial results to
be skipped (for result pagination)
| `getSingleResult()` | Execute a query and obtain the single result
| `getResultList()`   | Execute a query and obtain the results as a list
| `executeUpdate()`   | Execute a DML statement and obtain the number of
affected rows
|===

TIP: The Hibernate Reactive `Query` API doesn't support `java.util.Date`
or its subclasses in `java.sql`, nor `java.util.Calendar`. Always use
`java.time` types like `LocalDate` or `LocalDateTime` for specifying
arguments to temporally-typed query parameters.

For  JPA criteria queries, you must first obtain the `CriteriaBuilder` using
`SessionFactory.getCriteriaBuilder()`, and execute your query using
`Session.createQuery()`.

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
CriteriaQuery<Book> query = factory.getCriteriaBuilder().createQuery(Book.class);
Root<Author> a = query.from(Author.class);
Join<Author,Book> b = a.join(Author_.books);
query.where( a.get(Author_.name).in("Neal Stephenson", "William Gibson") );
query.select(b);
return session.createQuery(query).getResultList().invoke(
        books -> books.forEach( book -> out.println(book.title) )
);
----

=== Fetching lazy associations

In Hibernate ORM, a lazy association is fetched transparently when the
association is first accessed within a session. In Hibernate Reactive, on
the other hand, lazy association fetching is an asynchronous process that
produces a result via a `CompletionStage` (or `Uni`).

Therefore, lazy fetching is an explicit operation named `fetch()`, a static
method of `Stage` and `Mutiny`:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
session.find(Author.class, author.id)
       .chain( author -> Mutiny.fetch(author.books) )
       .invoke( books -> ... )
----

Of course, this isn't necessary if you fetch the association eagerly.

TIP: It's very important to make sure you've fetched all the data that
will be needed before passing control to the process that renders the
UI! There is no transparent lazy fetching in Hibernate Reactive, so
patterns like "open session in view" will _not help at all_.

Sometimes you might need to chain multiple calls to `fetch()`, for
example:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
Mutiny.fetch( session.getReference(detachedAuthor) )
       .chain( author -> Mutiny.fetch(author.books) )
       .invoke( books -> ... )
----

IMPORTANT: `fetch()` isn't recursive! You can't fetch an association
belonging to an unfetched entity without fetching the entity instance
first.

=== Field-level lazy fetching

Similarly, field-level lazy fetching&mdash;an advanced feature, which
is only supported in conjunction with Hibernate's optional compile-time
bytecode enhancer&mdash;is also an explicit operation.

To declare a lazy field we usually use the JPA `@Basic` annotation:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
@Basic(fetch=LAZY) String isbn;
----

An optional one-to-one association declared `@OneToOne(fetch=LAZY)` is
also considered field-level lazy.

IMPORTANT: This annotation has no effect at all unless the entity is
processed by the bytecode enhancer during the build. Most Hibernate
users don't bother with this, since it's often an inconvenience.

TIP: On the other hand, if you're running Hibernate Reactive in Quarkus,
the bytecode enhancer is always enabled, and you won't even notice it's
there.

A lazy field is only fetched if we explicitly request it by calling an
overloaded version of the `fetch()` operation:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
session.find(Book.class, book.id)
       .chain( book -> session.fetch(book, Book_.isbn) )
       .invoke( isbn -> ... )
----

Note that the field to fetch is identified by a JPA metamodel `Attribute`.

TIP: We don't encourage you to use field-level lazy fetching unless you
have very specific requirements. It's almost always more efficient to fetch
all the fields of an entity at once. Field-level lazy fetching is every bit
as vulnerable to N+1 selects as lazy association fetching.

=== Transactions

The `withTransaction()` method performs work within the scope of a database
transaction.

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
session.withTransaction( tx -> session.persist(book) )
----

The session is automatically flushed at the end of the transaction.

For a given `Session` object, nested calls to `withTransaction()` occur
within the same shared transaction context. However, notice that the
transaction is a _resource local_ transaction only, delegated to the
underlying Vert.x database client, and does not span multiple datasources,
nor integrate with JPA container-managed transactions.

IMPORTANT: Hibernate Reactive does not currently support distributed (XA)
transactions.

For extra convenience, there's a method that opens a session and starts a
transaction in one call:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
sessionFactory.withTransaction( (session, tx) -> session.persist(book) )
----

This is probably the most convenient thing to use most of the time.

== Integrating with Vert.x

:vertx-context-introduction: https://vertx.io/blog/an-introduction-to-the-vert-x-context-object/
:vertx-local-context: https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/Context.html#getLocal-java.lang.Object-
:vertx-get-context: https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#getOrCreateContext--
:vertx-runon-context: https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/Context.html#runOnContext-io.vertx.core.Handler-

At runtime, interaction with the database happens on a Vert.x thread,
typically the event loop thread. When you write code that creates and
destroys Hibernate Reactive sessions, it's important to understand how
sessions relate to threads and {vertx-context-introduction}[Vert.x contexts].

=== Sessions and Vert.x contexts

TIP: Remember how in regular old Hibernate JPA, you're not supposed to
share a session between multiple threads? Well, the idea here is essentially
similar, it's just that the notion of a "thread" is a little more slippery,
or at least more _technical_. You need to be able to replace the idea of a
"thread" with the idea of a chain of callbacks occurring on a reactive stream,
all within the scope of a certain Vert.x _local context_.

When you create a session using `withSession()` or `withTransaction()`, it's
automatically associated with the current Vert.x
{vertx-local-context}[local context], and propagates with the local context,
as mentioned above in <<_obtaining_a_reactive_session>>. And you're only
allowed to use the session from the thread that owns this local context. If
you screw up, and use it from a different thread, you might see this error:

----
HR000068: This method should exclusively be invoked from a Vert.x EventLoop thread; ...
----

On the other hand, if you use `openSession()`, you'll have to manage the
association between sessions and contexts yourself. Now, that's in principle
straightforward, but you'd be surprised how often people mess up.

IMPORTANT: The session is not thread-safe (or "stream-safe"), so using it across
different threads (or reactive streams) may cause bugs that are _extremely_ hard
to detect. Don't say we didn't warn you!

For example, I bet you would like to be able to write code like this:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
List<CompletionStage> list = ...
for (Entity entity : entities) {
    list.add(session.persist(entity));
}
CompletableFuture.allOf(list).thenCompose(session::flush);
----

Well, we're sorry, but that's just not allowed. Parallel reactive streams may not
share a session. Each stream must have its own session.

=== Executing code in a Vert.x context

What if you need to run a block of code within the scope of a Vert.x context, but
the current thread isn't associated with a `Context`? One solution is to obtain a
Vert.x `Context` object using {vertx-get-context}[`getOrCreateContext()`] and
then call {vertx-runon-context}[`runOnContext()`] to execute the code in that
context.

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
Context currentContext = Vertx.currentContext();
currentContext.runOnContext( event -> {
    // Here you will be able to use the session
});
----

Within the block of code passed to `runOnContext()`, you'll be able to use the
Hibernate Reactive session associated with the context.

=== Vert.x instance service

The `VertxInstance` service defines how Hibernate Reactive obtains an instance
of Vert.x. The default implementation just creates one the first time it's
needed. But if your program requires control over how the Vert.x instance is
created, or how it's obtained, you can override the default implementation and
provide your own `VertxInstance`. Let's consider this example:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
public class MyVertx implements VertxInstance {

  private final Vertx vertx;

  public MyVertx() {
    this.vertx = Vertx.vertx();
  }

  @Override
  public Vertx getVertx() {
    return vertx;
  }

}
----

One way to register this implementation is to configure Hibernate programmatically,
for example:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
StandardServiceRegistryBuilder builder = new ReactiveServiceRegistryBuilder()
        .addService( VertxInstance.class, new MyVertx() )
        .applySettings( configuration.getProperties() );
StandardServiceRegistry registry = builder.build();
SessionFactory sessionFactory = configuration.buildSessionFactory( registry );
----

Alternatively, you could implement the `ServiceContributor` interface.

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
public class MyServiceContributor implements ServiceContributor {
  @Override
  public void contribute(StandardServiceRegistryBuilder serviceRegistryBuilder) {
    serviceRegistryBuilder.addService( VertxInstance.class, new MyVertxProvider() );
  }
}
----

To register this `ServiceContributor`, add a text file named
`org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceContributor` to `/META-INF/services/`.

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
org.myproject.MyServiceContributor
----

//If you need to, you can access the `ServiceRegistry` from the `Stage.SessionFactory`
//or `Mutiny.SessionFactory` using the `org.hibernate.reactive.common.spi.Implementor`
//interface:
//
//[source, JAVA, indent=0]
//----
//Mutiny.SessionFactory sessionFactory = ...
//VertxInstance vertxInstance = ((Implementor) sessionFactory)
//					.getServiceRegistry()
// 					.getService( VertxInstance.class );
//Vertx vertx = vertxInstance.getVertx();
//----
//
//The same will work for `Stage.SessionFactory`.

== Tuning and performance

Once you have a program up and running using Hibernate Reactive to access
the database, it's inevitable that you'll find places where performance is
disappointing or unacceptable.

Fortunately, most performance problems are relatively easy to solve with
the tools that Hibernate makes available to you, as long as you keep a
couple of simple principles in mind.

First and most important: the reason you're using Hibernate Reactive is
because it makes things easier. If, for a certain problem, it's making
things _harder_, stop using it. Solve this problem with a different tool
instead.

IMPORTANT: Just because you're using Hibernate in your program doesn't mean
you have to use it _everywhere_.

Second: there are two main potential sources of performance bottlenecks in
a program that uses Hibernate:

- too many round trips to the database, and
- memory consumption associated with the first-level (session) cache.

So performance tuning primarily involves reducing the number of accesses
to the database, and/or controlling the size of the session cache.

But before we get to those more advanced topics, we should start by tuning
the connection pool.

=== Tuning the Vert.x pool

In <<_basic_configuration>> we already saw how to set the size of the
Vert.x database connection pool. When it comes time for performance tuning,
you can further customize the pool and prepared statement cache via the
following configuration properties:

|===
| Configuration property name                          | Purpose

| `hibernate.vertx.pool.max_wait_queue_size`           | The maximum connection requests allowed in the wait queue
| `hibernate.vertx.pool.connect_timeout`               | The maximum time to wait when requesting a pooled connection, in milliseconds
| `hibernate.vertx.pool.idle_timeout`                  | The maximum time a connection may sit idle, in milliseconds
| `hibernate.vertx.pool.cleaner_period`                | The Vert.x connection pool cleaner period, in milliseconds
| `hibernate.vertx.prepared_statement_cache.max_size`  | The maximum size of the prepared statement cache
| `hibernate.vertx.prepared_statement_cache.sql_limit` | The maximum length of prepared statement SQL string that will be cached
|===

Finally, for more advanced cases, you can write your own code to configure
the Vert.x client by implementing `SqlClientPoolConfiguration`.

|===
| Configuration property name                | Purpose

| `hibernate.vertx.pool.configuration_class` | A class implementing `SqlClientPoolConfiguration`
|===

=== Enabling statement batching

An easy way to improve performance of some transactions with almost no
work at all is to turn on automatic DML statement batching. Batching
only helps in cases where a program executes many inserts, updates, or
deletes against the same table in a single transaction.

All you need to do is set a single property:

|===
| Configuration property name | Purpose

| `hibernate.jdbc.batch_size` | Maximum batch size for SQL statement batching
|===

(Again, this property has `jdbc` in its name, but Hibernate Reactive
repurposes it for use with the reactive connection.)

TIP: Even better than DML statement batching is the use of HQL `update`
or `delete` queries, or even native SQL that calls a stored procedure!

=== Association fetching

:association-fetching: https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#fetching

Achieving high performance in ORM means minimizing the number of round
trips to the database. This goal should be uppermost in your mind
whenever you're writing data access code with Hibernate. The most
fundamental rule of thumb in ORM is:

- explicitly specify all the data you're going to need right at the start
of a session/transaction, and fetch it immediately in one or two queries,
- and only then start navigating associations between persistent entities.

Without question, the most common cause of poorly-performing data access
code in Java programs is the problem of _N+1 selects_. Here, a list of N
rows is retrieved from the database in an initial query, and then
associated instances of a related entity are fetched using N subsequent
queries.

IMPORTANT: Hibernate code which does this is bad code and makes
Hibernate look bad to people who don't realize that it's their own
fault for not following the advice in this section!

Hibernate provides several strategies for efficiently fetching
associations and avoiding N+1 selects:

- outer join fetching,
- batch fetching, and
- subselect fetching.

Of these, you should almost always use outer join fetching. Batch
fetching and subselect fetching are only useful in rare cases where
outer join fetching would result in a cartesian product and a huge
result set. Unfortunately, outer join fetching simply isn't possible
with lazy fetching.

TIP: Avoid the use of lazy fetching, which is often the source of
N+1 selects.

It follows from this tip that you shouldn't need to use `Stage.fetch()`
or `Mutiny.fetch()` very often!

Now, we're not saying that associations should be mapped for eager
fetching by default! That would be a terrible idea, resulting in
simple session operations that fetch the entire database! Therefore:

TIP: Most associations should be mapped for lazy fetching by default.

It sounds as if this tip is in contradiction to the previous one, but
it's not. It's saying that you must explicitly specify eager fetching
for associations precisely when and where they are needed.

If you need eager fetching in some particular transaction, use:

- `left join fetch` in HQL,
- a fetch profile,
- a JPA `EntityGraph`, or
- `fetch()` in a criteria query.

You can find much more information about association fetching in the
{association-fetching}[documentation for Hibernate ORM].

=== Enabling the second-level cache

:second-level-cache: https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#caching

A classic way to reduce the number of accesses to the database is to
use a second-level cache, allowing cached data to be shared between
sessions.

Hibernate Reactive supports second-level cache implementations that
perform no blocking I/O.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you disable any disk-based storage or distributed
replication used by your preferred cache implementation. A second-level
cache which uses blocking I/O to interact with the network or disk-based
storage will at least partially negate the advantages of the reactive
programming model.

Configuring Hibernate's second-level cache is a rather involved topic,
and quite outside the scope of this document. But in case it helps, we're
testing Hibernate Reactive with the following configuration, which uses
EHCache as the cache implementation, as above in <<_optional_dependencies>>:

|===
| Configuration property name              | Property value

| `hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache` | `true`
| `hibernate.cache.region.factory_class`   | `org.hibernate.cache.jcache.JCacheRegionFactory`
| `hibernate.javax.cache.provider`         | `org.ehcache.jsr107.EhcacheCachingProvider`
| `hibernate.javax.cache.uri`              | `/ehcache.xml`
|===

If you're using EHCache, you'll also need to include an `ehcache.xml` file
that explicitly configures the behavior of each cache region belonging to
your entities and collections.

TIP: Don't forget that you need to explicitly mark each entity that will
be stored in the second-level cache with the `@Cache` annotation from
`org.hibernate.annotations`.

You can find much more information about the second-level cache in the
{second-level-cache}[documentation for Hibernate ORM].

=== Session cache management

Entity instances aren't automatically evicted from the session cache when
they're no longer needed. (The session cache is quite different to the
second-level cache in this respect!) Instead, they stay pinned in memory
until the session they belong to is discarded by your program.

The methods `detach()` and `clear()` allow you to remove entities from the
session cache, making them available for garbage collection. Since most
sessions are rather short-lived, you won't need these operations very often.
And if you find yourself thinking you _do_ need them in a certain situation,
you should strongly consider an alternative solution: a _stateless session_.

=== Stateless sessions

An arguably-underappreciated feature of Hibernate is the `StatelessSession`
interface, which provides a command-oriented, more bare-metal approach to
interacting with the database.

You may obtain a reactive stateless session from the `SessionFactory`:

[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
Stage.StatelessSession ss = getSessionFactory().openStatelessSession();
----

A stateless session:

- doesn't have a first-level cache (persistence context), nor does it interact
  with any second-level caches, and
- doesn't implement transactional write-behind or automatic dirty checking,
  so all operations are executed immediately when they're explicitly called.

For a stateless session, you're always working with detached objects. Thus,
the programming model is a bit different:

|===
| Method name and parameters | Effect

| `get(Class, Object)` | Obtain a detached object, given its type and its id,
                         by executing a `select`
| `fetch(Object)`      | Fetch an association of a detached object
| `refresh(Object)`    | Refresh the state of a detached object by executing
                         a `select`
| `insert(Object)`     | Immediately `insert` the state of the given
                         transient object into the database
| `update(Object)`     | Immediately `update` the state of the given detached
                         object in the database
| `delete(Object)`     | Immediately `delete` the state of the given detached
                         object from the database
|===

NOTE: There's no `flush()` operation, and so `update()` is always explicit.

In certain circumstances, this makes stateless sessions easier to work with,
but with the caveat that a stateless session is much more vulnerable to data
aliasing effects, since it's easy to get two non-identical Java objects which
both represent the same row of a database table.

IMPORTANT: If you use `fetch()` in a stateless session, you can very easily
obtain two objects representing the same database row!

In particular, the absence of a persistence context means that you can safely
perform bulk-processing tasks without allocating huge quantities of memory.
Use of a `StatelessSession` alleviates the need to call:

- `clear()` or `detach()` to perform first-level cache management, and
- `setCacheMode()` to bypass interaction with the second-level cache.

TIP: Stateless sessions can be useful, but for bulk operations on huge datasets,
Hibernate can't possibly compete with stored procedures!

When using a stateless session, you should be aware of the following additional
limitations:

- persistence operations never cascade to associated instances,
- changes to `@ManyToMany` associations and ``@ElementCollection``s cannot be made
  persistent, and
- operations performed via a stateless session bypass callbacks.

=== Optimistic and pessimistic locking

Finally, an aspect of behavior under load that we didn't mention above is row-level
data contention. When many transactions try to read and update the same data, the
program might become unresponsive with lock escalation, deadlocks, and lock
acquisition timeout errors.

There's two basic approaches to data concurrency in Hibernate:

- optimistic locking using `@Version` columns, and
- database-level pessimistic locking using the SQL `for update` syntax (or equivalent).

In the Hibernate community it's _much_ more common to use optimistic locking, and
Hibernate makes that incredibly easy.

TIP: Where possible, in a multiuser system, avoid holding a pessimistic lock across
a user interaction. Indeed, the usual practice is to avoid having transactions that
span user interactions. For multiuser systems, optimistic locking is king.

That said, there _is_ also a place for pessimistic locks, which can sometimes reduce
the probability of transaction rollbacks.

Therefore, the `find()`, `lock()`, and `refresh()` methods of the reactive session
accept an optional `LockMode`. You can also specify a `LockMode` for a query. The
lock mode can be used to request a pessimistic lock, or to customize the behavior
of optimistic locking:

|===
| `LockMode` type | Meaning

| `READ`                        | An optimistic lock obtained implicitly whenever
                                  an entity is read from the database using `select`
| `OPTIMISTIC`                  | An optimistic lock obtained when an entity is
                                  read from the database, and verified using a
                                  `select` to check the version when the
                                  transaction completes
| `OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT`  | An optimistic lock obtained when an entity is
                                  read from the database, and enforced using an
                                  `update` to increment the version when the
                                  transaction completes
| `WRITE`                       | A pessimistic lock obtained implicitly whenever
                                  an entity is written to the database using
                                  `update` or `insert`
| `PESSIMISTIC_READ`            | A pessimistic `for share` lock
| `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE`           | A pessimistic `for update` lock
| `PESSIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT` | A pessimistic lock enforced using an immediate
                                  `update` to increment the version
|===

== Custom connection management and multitenancy

Hibernate Reactive supports custom management of reactive connections by letting
you define your own implementation of `ReactiveConnectionPool`, or extend the
built-in implementation `DefaultSqlClientPool`.

|===
| Configuration property name | Value

| `hibernate.vertx.pool.class` | A class which implements `ReactiveConnectionPool`
|===

A common motivation for defining a custom pool is the need to support multitenancy.
In a multitenant application, the database or database schema depends on the current
tenant identifier. The easiest way to set this up in Hibernate Reactive is to extend
`DefaultSqlClientPool` and override `getTenantPool(String tenantId)`.

For multitenancy, you'll also need to set at least one of the following
configuration properties defined by Hibernate ORM:

|===
| Configuration property name            | Value

| `hibernate.multiTenancy`               | The multitenancy strategy: `database` or `schema`
| `hibernate.tenant_identifier_resolver` | (Optional) A class which implements `CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver`
|===

If you don't provide a `CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver`, you can specify
the tenant id explicitly when you call `openSession()`, `withSession()`,
or `withTransaction()`.
