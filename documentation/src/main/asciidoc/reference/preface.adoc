Hibernate Reactive is a reactive API for Hibernate ORM, supporting non-blocking database drivers and a reactive style of
interaction with the database.

Hibernate Reactive is intended for use in a reactive programming environment like Vert.x, where interaction with the
database should occur in a non-blocking fashion. Persistence operations are orchestrated via the construction of a
reactive stream rather than via direct invocation of synchronous functions in procedural Java code. The reactive stream
is represented using a chain of Java ``CompletionStage``s or Mutiny ``Uni``s and ``Multi``s.

Java persistence frameworks like JDBC, JPA and Hibernate ORM were designed to use blocking IO for interaction with the
database, and are therefore not appropriate for use in a reactive environment. As far as we know, Hibernate Reactive
is the first true ORM implementation designed to take advantage of non-blocking database clients. Out of the box, the
Vert.x clients for PostgreSQL, MySQL, DB2, SQL Server, Oracle, and CockroachDB are supported, though the architecture 
is not limited to these drivers.

This programming paradigm holds the potential for improved scalability, and more controlled degradation under peak load,
in some runtime scenarios. However, in general, one should not expect to see an immediate performance gain in all
performance tests. Indeed, many programs will *not* benefit from the programming model, and those which do benefit might
only benefit in very specific load scenarios.
