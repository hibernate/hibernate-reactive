# JDK auto-detection is not quite ready yet in Gradle 6.7.
# On Fedora in particular, if you have the package java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless-1.8.0.265.b01-1.fc32.x86_64 installed,
# Gradle will look for the Java binaries in /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.265.b01-1.fc32.x86_64/bin/java
# but it won't find it and will fail.
# It's just a JRE, so it's perfectly normal that the JDK is not present;
# the JRE is under /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.265.b01-1.fc32.x86_64/jre
