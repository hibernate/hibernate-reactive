/**
 * A pool of reactive connections backed by a Vert.x {@link Pool}.
 * <p>
 * This is an alternative to
 * {@link org.hibernate.reactive.pool.impl.DefaultSqlClientPool},
 * for use when one doesn't want Hibernate Reactive to manage the
 * lifecycle of the underlying {@code Pool}.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is meant to be used in Quarkus or other runtimes.
 * <p>
 *     N.B. the injected pool instance is required to be threadsafe,
 *     while the default implementation in Vert.x version 3 is not.
 *     So use this only by extensions of the default implementation
 *     which can deliver a different actual underlying {@link Pool}
 *     instance for each thread.
 *     All clients of the pool instances retrieved from the injected
 *     {@link Pool} instance are expected to be running on a Vert.x
 *     event loop.
 *     Integration tests in Hibernate Reactive run exclusively on the
 *     Vert.x event loop, however in practice this will need to be
 *     guaranteed by the integrating runtime as well.
 *     Alternatively, a valid integration mode which doesn't require
 *     wrapping the {@code Pool} instance with a {@code ThreadLocal}
 *     could be devised by having all of the use of the Hibernate
 *     Reactive's SessionFactory instance ({@link Stage.SessionFactory}
 *     or a {@link Mutiny.SessionFactory}) constrained within a single
 *     thread, running within the Vert.x event loop.
