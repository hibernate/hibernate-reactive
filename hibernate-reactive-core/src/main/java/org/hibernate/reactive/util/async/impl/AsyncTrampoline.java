/**
 * Copy of com.ibm.asyncutil.iteration.AyncTrampoline from com.ibm.async:asyncutil:0.1.0
 * without all the methods and imports we don't need for Hibernate Reactive.
 * <p>
 * Static methods for asynchronous looping procedures without exhausting the stack.
 *
 * <p>
 * When working with {@link InternalStage}, it's often desirable to have a loop like construct
 * which keeps producing stages until some condition is met. Because continuations are asynchronous,
 * it's usually easiest to do this with a recursive approach:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * InternalStage<Integer> getNextNumber();
 *
 * InternalStage<Integer> getFirstOddNumber(int current) {
 *   if (current % 2 != 0)
 *     // found odd number
 *     return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(current);
 *   else
 *     // get the next number and recurse
 *     return getNextNumber().thenCompose(next -> getFirstOddNumber(next));
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The problem with this is that if the implementation of getNextNumber happens to be synchronous
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * InternalStage<Integer> getNextNumber() {
 *   return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(random.nextInt());
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * then getFirstOddNumber can easily cause a stack overflow. This situation often happens when a
 * cache is put under an async API, and all the values are cached and returned immediately. This
 * could be avoided by scheduling the recursive calls back to a thread pool using
 * {@link CompletionStage#thenComposeAsync}, however the overhead of the thread pool submissions may
 * be high and may cause unnecessary context switching.
 *
 * <p>
 * The methods on this class ensure that the stack doesn't blow up - if multiple calls happen on the
 * same thread they are queued and run in a loop. You could write the previous example like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * InternalStage<Integer> getFirstOddNumber(int initial) {
 *   return AsyncTrampoline.asyncWhile(
 *    i -> i % 2 == 0,
 *    i -> getNextNumber(),
 *    initial);
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Though this class provides efficient methods for a few loop patterns, many are better represented
 * by the more expressive API available on {@link AsyncIterator}, which is also stack safe. For
 * example, the preceding snippet can be expressed as {@code
 * AsyncIterator.generate(this::getNextNumber).find(i -> i % 2 != 0)}
 *
 * @see AsyncIterator
